<!-- Collection Description -->
<p></p><br/><p>Frances Winton Champ lived and breathed music. A resident of Cache Valley, Utah, this accomplished pianist performed as a solist with the Boston, Chicago, and Utah Symphonies, she also composed and taught music. Serving as a musical snapshot of Cache Valley history, this collection includes not only popular music anthologies and sheet music, but also numerous printed programs detailing Champ's piano recitals and performances as well as cultural artifacts offering a glimpse into the rich artistic life of Logan during the late 1920s through the 1940s. Many of the vintage scores are beautifully printed with several important music publishers in both Europe and the United States represented. Some handwritten pieces are illustrated by former USU professor and artist Everett Thorpe. One, published for the beginning piano student, uses themes from Western Native American culture.</p><br/></p>
