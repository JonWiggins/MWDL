<!-- Collection Description -->
This collection of photographs, slides and diagrams is from Mr. Von Del Chamberlain, whose career has focused on cultural astronomy--a field of study that focuses on the investigation of astronomy from cultures around the world, past and present. The collection includes many rare images of Native American star ceilings, petroglyphs, and structures that reflect their interest in and knowledge of astronomy, as well as those from Egypt, Central America, and the British Isles. Mr. Chamberlain worked at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. (1978-84), where he was chief of the Education and Presentations Division at the National Air and Space Museum. He then returned to his home state of Utah, becoming the director of the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake City (1984-96). After retiring from his duties there, he taught classes at Utah Valley State College (1996-2004). He was appointed Scholar in Residence there in 1998, granting him the rank of Associate Professor. Many of these images were used in his classes and feature highlights of his own work and that of his colleagues. Mr. Chamberlain is currently retired and living in Kanab, Utah where he continues to work on publishing articles and books in the field of cultural astronomy.
