<!-- Collection Description -->
</p>
The student newspaper for Salt Lake Community College has been published under a number of different names. The Tradesman is the earliest title found to-date and the single issue on file was published in 1959. Tech Topics was published from December 1962 until August 1973. Utah Tech News was published as a supplement to the Murray Eagle for what looks like a single issue in August 1973. Beginning in September 1973 the title became Points West until June 1987. While a new name was being sought from student suggestions the masthead for the paper read No Name Paper for four issues from September to October 1987. The new name decided upon was Horizon which lasted from October 1987 until March 2001. The student newspaper resumed publication under its current name The Globe in October 2001.</p>
