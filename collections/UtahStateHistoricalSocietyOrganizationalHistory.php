<!-- Collection Description -->
"Among the most important records in this series are those original documents organizing the Historical Society and defining its purpose. Using this series one can trace the organizational history of the society from its beginning with a ""Call to Organize"" in 1897, to its designation as a state government agency in 1917, and its continued growth to include the large number of programs it currently supports. Important records of this variety include the original ""Call to Organize"" printed on July 15, 1897, the original Historical Society charter filed in Salt Lake City on December 31, 1897, and a copy of the Society's original Articles of Incorporation and By-laws from December 28, 1897 which set up the earliest parameters for how the Society would operate."
