A Sermon Preached at Saint Dunstans
<!-- Article Text -->
</p><br/>Though John Donne is known to his twenty-first century reader primarily as a poet, it is as a preacher that he reached his highest fame during his lifetime, and for his sermons that he expected to be remembered. From his first extant sermon in April 1615, delivered before Queen Anne when Donne was a newly-minted clergyman, to his famous last sermon Death's Duell , Donne's homiletic work displays a remarkable range of learning and interest. At the heart of Donne's sermons lies an energy of mind that exhorts its audience to attend, to reflect, and even to wrestle with God after the example of Donne himself.</p><br/>
