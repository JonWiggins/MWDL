Lyman D. Wilbur's slides from his visits to Afghanistan in 1957 and 1958 are part of a larger collection of his papers (MSS 205) donated to Boise State University by his daughter, Olive G. Waugh, in 2001. The collection as a whole documents Wilbur's career as an engineer, including his four decades with the Boise, Idaho-based international engineering and construction firm Morrison-Knudsen
