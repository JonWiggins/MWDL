ChinaVine�s mission is to educate children, youth, and adults about China�s cultural heritage. This mission is primarily achieved through�ChinaVine.org�and the ChinaVine Digital Archive (CVDA). CVDA is a collection of materials interpreting China�s cultural heritage and is largely associated with fieldwork conducted in China by ChinaVine Scholars. This archive supports, and extends, the materials available on�ChinaVine.org. ChinaVine began with a partnership initiated in 2007 between the University of Oregon (UO), the University of Central Florida (UCF), and Shandong University of Art and Design (SUAD). Subsequent partnerships between the UO, UCF, and Beijing Normal University, East China Normal University, Minzu University, the University of Maine, and other institutions in the People's Republic of China and the United States contribute to the website and this archive. UO Professor Doug Blandy and Professor Emerita Kristin G. Congdon at UCF direct ChinaVine. Development of the archive was overseen by UO Professor John Fenn, Jonathan Lederman (2011-2014) and Bridget Hall (2014-2015), graduate students in the UO Arts and Administration Program, and Karen Estlund, Head of the UO Libraries Digital Scholarship Center.
