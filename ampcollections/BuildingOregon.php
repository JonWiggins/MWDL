Building Oregon: Architecture of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest provides approximately 20,000 images with accompanying documentation about the architectural heritage of the Pacific Northwest with special emphasis on Oregon�s historic sites and built environment. A significant number of images come from slides donated to the University of Oregon Libraries, including the�collections of architectural historian Marion Dean Ross, preservationist Michael Shellenbarger, and architect C. Gilman Davis. As a result of continuing collaboration with the�Oregon State Historic Preservation Office, many documents in the collection represent works listed on the�National Register of Historic Places.
