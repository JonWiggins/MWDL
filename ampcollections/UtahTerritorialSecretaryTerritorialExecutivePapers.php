<em>Territorial Secretary Territorial Executive Papers, 1849-1896 </em>
<!-- Article Text -->
</p><br/>The territorial secretary was responsible for recording all acts and proceedings of the Governor in his executive department and to provide copies of these official acts to specific federal officials. Over half of the series represent official acts of the Governor. Many other duties of the secretary are also documented, most reflecting routine administrative functions of the territorial government. </p><br/>
