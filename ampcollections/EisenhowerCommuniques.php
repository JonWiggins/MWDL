113-145, August 1944
<!-- Article Text -->
</p><br/>These communiqu√©s were designed mainly as a guide to correspondents covering battlefront activities, though they also served to keep various branches of the Allied forces informed and coordinated. (They were not secret or confidential.) The reports do not describe the local horror and suffering from bombs and bullets but provide an overall, almost businesslike, account of the Allied advance across France, the Netherlands, and Germany</p><br/>
