</p><br/>In the summer of 1985 a team of folklife specialists (folklorists, architectural historians, & historians) from the Library of Congress and Utah spent a couple of weeks living in Grouse Creek, interviewing its people and recording its history and culture. The survey's interviews, photographs, slides, and field notes presented here are digital facsimiles of originals deposited at Utah State University 's Fife Folklore Archives as Folk Collection 21.</p><br/>
