</p><br/>The collection consists of slides taken of signs painted on buildings in Salt Lake City. Varley also took photographs of street scenes at the same location (one ca. 1890s, one, 1986) to show changes over time. The photographer also took photographs of historic buildings on the Historic Register, 400 South to 200 North between 400 East and 400 West.</p><br/>
