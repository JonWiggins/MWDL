The Idaho Wilderness collection commemorates the 50th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Wilderness Act with primary source material documenting the political issues surrounding the management of public lands in Idaho. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a system for the United States government to designate specific wild areas of America as wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 3, 1964. ?A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.?
