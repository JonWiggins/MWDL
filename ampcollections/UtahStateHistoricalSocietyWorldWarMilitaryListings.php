The Utah State Historical Society collected and compiled information on Utahns serving in the World Wars. These records consist primarily of lists of Utah men and women killed, wounded, missing, and discharged with overseas service. Assorted correspondence, newspaper clippings, veteran ceremony programs, service questionnaires, and tributes to the dead also are included. The majority of the material pertains to World War II.
