</p><br/>This collection comprises 60 images taken by Utah architect, Taylor Woolley. The majority of the images are at Frank Lloyd Wright's home, Taliesin I, c. 1911-1912. Woolley worked under Frank Lloyd Wright for a time, traveling with him to Europe and later helping in the construction of Taliesin I in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Woolley captured some unique images of the construction of Taliesin I, both interior and exterior, as well as images showing the intricate details of the home.</p><br/>
