</p><br/>Family correspondence from the Clawson and Spencer families, including letters from Hiram Clawson to his wife, Ellen Spencer Clawson, and letters from Orson Spencer to his children. Included are party invitations to Hiram Clawson and a few playbills from the Salt Lake Theatre. The Hiram B. Clawson papers (1846-1947) consist mainly of correspondence. The earliest letters are from 1847, and are of Orson Spencer to his children in Council Bluffs and Salt Lake City while on his mission to the British Isles and from relatives of Catherine Curtis Spencer showing concern for the children.</p><br/>&nbsp
