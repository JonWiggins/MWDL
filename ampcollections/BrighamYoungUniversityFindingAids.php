<p></p><br/><p>The Society of American Archivists glossary defines finding aids as:</p><br/><p>Finding aids typically have two components: an overview of the collection and a detailed inventory of the contents of the collection. The overview of the collection describes who created the materials, the scope of the collection, the arrangement of the collection, and any access restrictions on the materials. The detailed inventory describes the contents of the collection at the series-level and the file or item-level. Finding aids are created to help researchers gain access to the materials.</p><br/></p>
