Swaner Legacy - Oral History Project
<!-- Article Text -->
"In 2010 the Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter (Snyderville Basin, Park City, Utah) was donated to Utah State University, making it the largest gift in USU history. Known to native peoples as the ""Hole in the Sky,"" the preserve encompasses a 1,200-acre wildlife preserve and state of the art environmental education facility. The dream of the preserve started in 1992, when Dr. Paula Swaner and her children pursued a way to honor their late husband and father Leland Swaner; ; and culminated in the impressive, one-of-a-kind preserve in the high desert. In 2015, USU Special Collections was given the opportunity to document the familyï¿½s legacy story. This collection comprises of five interviews with Swaner family members. The finding aid for this collection is found at http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv46444. Visit the Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter website http://www.swanerecocenter.org/."
