Federal enabling act
<!-- Article Text -->
</p><br/>On July 1894, the U.S. Congress enacted a law to enable the territory of Utah to be admitted into the Union as a state. The act spelled out the calling of a convention composed of 107 delegates to meet beginning in March 1895 to draw up a state constitution. These records are the papers of that convention. They include a copy of the federal enabling act, roll call, transcripts, published and unpublished, of the proceedings, files of proposals, petitions, and other recommendations for inclusion in the state constitution, and a limited number of committee reports, minutes and notes.</p><br/>
