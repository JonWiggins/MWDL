<!-- Article Text -->
These records contain birth registers recorded during the years 1898 through 1904. Each entry has an assigned number, name of father, name of mother, date of birth, name of child, sex, race, color, residence of parents, and name of informant making the report. Beginning in 1898, physicians and midwives were required to keep record of each birth at which they assisted professionally. In their absence, parents were required to make a report. They then reported quarterly to the county clerk or in the case of incorporated cities, to the local board of health and they would report to the county clerk. (Revised Statutes of Utah 1898, Title 57, p. 474-475) In 1905, the state passed a law requiring each county to file a uniform certificate with the State Bureau of Vital Statistics.
