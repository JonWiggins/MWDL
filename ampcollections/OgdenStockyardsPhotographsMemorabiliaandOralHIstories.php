<!-- Article Text -->
The Ogden Union Stockyard was a key fixture in the largest livestock market west of Denver during its heyday from 1916 to 1971. The activities at the yard brought Ogden national attention as a livestock center. The rise of the livestock shows, auctions, etc. at the site spurred the local and regional livestock industry, thereby physically shaping the development of the agricultural landscape both near and far.
