</p><br/>Spanning from 1904 to 1980, Weber State had many different literary publications. Some periodicals had a longer run than others, but all provide an interesting feel for the social life of their time and a glimpse into Weber's past. The publications include: The Acorn from 1904-16; The Weber Literary Journal from 1921-26; Acorn Crumbs from 1931-34; Scribulus from 1935-66 and doubling as a yearbook for several years; Transit from 1942-43; The Selector in 1948; The New Touch in 1948; Probe from 1968-72; Kaleidoscope in 1968; and The Aardvark Review from 1978-80.
