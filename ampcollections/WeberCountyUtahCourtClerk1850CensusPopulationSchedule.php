Weber County (Utah) Court Clerk 1850 Census Population Schedule
<!-- Article Text -->
This series contains a copy of the 1850 United States Census for Weber County on original federal forms, comprised of 28 pages. This census represents the first time that Weber County and the rest of Utah Territory was enumerated by the federal government. The series is significant, in part, because it was previously believed by many that the 1850 census for Utah was only taken on handmade forms and that Utah did not have access to the federal forms. However, these records make it clear that federal forms were available and raise the question of why Utah Territory submitted handmade forms to the Census Bureau.
