Boise Fire Department Engine
<!-- Article Text -->
The Doc Roach Collection consists mostly of photographs that reflect his long career with the Boise Fire Department. Doc was one of the few firemen who worked from the days of horse-drawn fire engines, witnessed the introduction of motorized equipment in 1912, and also used gasoline pump trucks. Doc collected photographs which document the fire fighters, equipment, major fires, and fire prevention education in Boise from 1911-1965. These photographs also document the growth of Boise from a small town to a city in the first half of the 20th century, including shots taken of the greater downtown area, capturing changes in transportation and buildings. Many of the photographs in the Doc Roach collection were used in a book on the history of fire departments in Boise by Arthur Hart (Fighting Fire on the Frontier, 1976).
