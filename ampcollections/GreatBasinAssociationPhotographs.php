</p><br/>The Great Basin Association maintains this photo collection of Great Basin National Park. Located in Eastern Nevada, the once-thought barren area is full of unique wildlife and geological formations. This collection contains a number of antiquated photos, depicting early developments in the National Park, as well as contemporary photos of its landscape and park facilities.</p><br/>
