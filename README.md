# MWDL

## About
mwdl.org is a non-profit website that organizes digital library collections from academic and private conservatory institutions across the Midwest.


This repository is a collection of scripts that I created when working at the University of Utah library. It holds scripts that are used to generate pages for the mwdl.org website and divide up google analytics reports into spreadsheets to be sent to the libraryâ€™s partner institutions.


## Use
`ProjectConstants.java` points to the source files from which data is pulled. 
`org.mwdl` holds collections of scripts that do various tasks with this data.
